#My Portfolio

The goal of this repo was to create a professional site that allowed potential employers and fellow developers to gain 
information about me. Within this website, I included 3 different pages which author a biography about myself, a page for to contact me via email for potential employing opportunities as well as a portfolio page to show my future projects.

Within the guidelines of building our personal porfolio website, I was to only use Bootstrap components. Using Bootstrap, I was able to customize several functions and sections of my page as well as utilizing Bootstraps innovative grid system components.

Creating this website was very important in laying the ground work for future websites and personal projects- as well as being able to create a repository that allows me to go back in the future and add features to.
