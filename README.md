##My Portfolio

#The goal of this repo was to create a professional site that allowed potential employers and fellow developers to gain 
information about me. Within this website, I included 3 different pages which author a biography about myself, a page for to contact me via email for potential employing opportunities as well as a portfolio page to show my future projects.

#Within the guidelines of building our personal porfolio website, I was to only use Bootstrap components. Using Bootstrap, I was able to customize several functions and sections of my page as well as utilizing Bootstraps innovative grid system components.

#Creating this website was very important in laying the ground work for future websites and personal projects- as well as being able to create a repository that allows me to go back in the future and add features to.
